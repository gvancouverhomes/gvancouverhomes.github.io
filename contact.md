## Contact

If you’re reaching out, it’s likely because you’ve already done your homework.

Most people who contact me are either ready to move forward, or very close and looking to clear up a few final questions about the process before they do. In both cases, the purpose of the first conversation is the same: clarity.

This is a focused conversation to understand where you’re headed, what matters to you, and whether working together makes sense.

**This conversation is a good fit if:**
- Your decision to buy or sell is already made, or nearly made  
- You value a steady, deliberate approach  
- You’re clear on what you want and ready to move forward, with the expectation that it’s handled properly  

These conversations tend to be most useful when the direction is already clear, or very close.
