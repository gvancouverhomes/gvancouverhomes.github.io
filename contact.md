# Let’s talk about your next move

Every move starts with a conversation. If you’re considering a buy, sale, or private search, this is the place to begin.

**Call or text:** [604-897-7826](tel:+16048977826)  
**Email:** [tanvir@tanvirbhupal.com](mailto:tanvir@tanvirbhupal.com)

If you’re reaching out, it’s likely because you’ve already done your homework.

Most people who contact me are either ready to move forward, or very close. The purpose of the first conversation is clarity around where you’re headed, what matters, and whether working together makes sense.

**This conversation is a good fit if:**
• Your decision to buy or sell is already made, or very close
• You value a steady, deliberate approach

These conversations tend to be most useful when the direction is already clear, or very close.
