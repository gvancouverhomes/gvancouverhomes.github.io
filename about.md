# About Tanvir

I became licensed in 2011 and have guided clients through moves of all sizes and stages. Some were buying for the first time. Others were stepping into a long-awaited dream. Every one carried its own weight and meaning.  

In 2022, I became a father to my son. In 2024, my daughter arrived. Those years changed the way I see the world. I took time to understand what it means to be present, to lead a life where my children are the main characters. That shift brought stillness. It taught me to focus on what matters most to the people I serve.  

When I returned to real estate, it was with a clearer purpose. I work with intention, bringing precision to pricing, care to presentation, and an unwavering commitment to your outcome.  

If you’re buying, I’ll help you move with confidence. If you’re selling, I’ll position your property to attract the right eyes and the right offers.  

Whether you’re arriving in Greater Vancouver or moving within it, I’ll guide the process from our first conversation to the moment the keys are in your hand.
