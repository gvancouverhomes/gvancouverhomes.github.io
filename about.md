    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
    <p>I have been licensed since 2011, guiding clients through their most complex and meaningful transactions. From first-time purchases to legacy properties, each has required a tailored approach and precise execution.</p>
    <p>Becoming a father deepened my perspective. It sharpened my focus on what truly matters and reinforced the care I have always brought to my work. That clarity now guides every decision I make for my clients.</p>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>I work with people who value a steady, deliberate process. My role is to listen first, plan with precision, and manage each stage so you can move forward with certainty. At this level, real estate is best handled with quiet confidence and exacting attention to detail.</p>

    <h2>For Buyers</h2>
    <p>Whether you are relocating to Greater Vancouver or moving within it, I will help you secure the right property with efficiency and discretion. From private opportunities to the best of the market, I present options that are carefully matched to you, including off-market properties.</p>

    <h2>For Sellers</h2>
    <p>Selling a high-value property is about control. Success is determined by the right audience, timing, and positioning.</p>
    <p>I design the sale to protect your privacy while creating genuine demand. Every element is deliberate: pricing, presentation, timing. Exposure is selective, ensuring your home attracts qualified buyers and serious offers.</p>
    <p>You stay informed, never overwhelmed. The process moves with precision, your standards stay intact, and the result is exactly what it should be â€” private, profitable, and on your terms.</p>

    <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
    <p>If we work together, you can expect clarity at every step and results that reflect your priorities. You will know exactly where we are in the process without having to manage it yourself.</p>
    <p>Whether you are buying or selling, my role is to protect your time, your privacy, and your outcome.</p>
