## How searches usually take shape

Most searches start broad, then resolve into a mix of municipalities and specific neighbourhoods. The distinction becomes clear once priorities, lifestyle, and timing are defined.

## A private way to search

Some searches are better handled quietly. If you’d rather not create accounts or leave a digital trail, I can run a private search and share only what’s relevant.
