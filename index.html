    <h2>It Starts Here</h2>
    <p>This blog isn't about pushing properties or chasing trends. It's here to offer clear insights and grounded perspectives for anyone who truly cares about how they live and where they invest.</p>
    <p>I tend to attract clients who are thoughtful and secure in their decisions. They grasp the market, understand timing, and act confidently when the right opportunity arises.</p>
    <p>Whether they're upgrading, relocating, or adjusting their position with purpose, one thing connects them all: clarity. They know what matters and move when it makes sense.</p>
    <p>This space mirrors that energy. If thoughtful conversation and quiet clarity resonate with you, you'll feel right at home here.</p>
